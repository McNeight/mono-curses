mono-curses
===========

This provides both a low-level API, as well as a simple console
UI toolkit called `gui.cs`.

The goal of this library was to bind curses.  There is a
low-level binding in binding.cs and a few chunks in handles.cs
that provide a basic abstraction.

The focus of this work though has been on a simple GUI toolkit
for writing desktop applications, inspired on the 15 year old
work that I did for the Midnight Commander (you can tell I
like those colors). 

The work in `gui' does not take advantage of curses "WINDOWS"
or the Panel library as am not familiar with them, instead we
create our own abstraction here. 

Example
=======

I recently added a neutered version of an old UI I did for MonoTorrent
that has the actual torrent code removed, but shows how to use
the gui.cs toolkit.

To run, just type `make grun`
